== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use Scss, Bourbon to develop the theme? =

The theme is ready for use and if you don't know about theme development then ignore this section and carry on using the theme like you would any other. If you do know about theme development then you can access all the files in the theme folder including the scss files. You'll need a pre-proccessor for parsing the scss to css, two recommended and cheap pre-processors are listed below. You can use the command line if you prefer.

= How do I use the Page Templates? =

Sitemap
Enable this page via the page templates when making a new page. Add some content eg a sitemap introduction, add a post thumbnail if you wish. When viewed the page should show all your posts, pages, categories etc after your content. This sitemap is a user friendly quick access to your site links and is not a substitute for a search engine xml sitemap, which are usually created via a plugin eg.'Yoast SEO'



= Additional Notes =

The Author Page
You can set an image for the Author page background in the Profile area of the admin section.

Post Images
The post images don't use the alignleft, alignright, aligncenter and alignnone. The images are set to be centered so try and use the full width if possible for more effect.

Post Content
The post content is 840px wide

Prism js
The theme uses prism.js, an alternative to google code. More information can be found on the highlight website http://???????.
